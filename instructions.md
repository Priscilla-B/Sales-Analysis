## Setting up Project environment
- in your bash terminal, type *mkdir data-exploration* to create a new folder called data exploration. This is the folder that will keep our data and all the files we will create to view, clean and analyze the data. You can alternatively create this folder directly on your local machine
- open the folder on your local machine and add the excel file that contains our raw data to this folder
- navigate back to bash in vscode and type *cd data-exploration*. This will change your location in bash to the data-exploration directory(folder).
