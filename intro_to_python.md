## What is Python?
Python is a general purpose programming language for solving a variety of problems.

## What are some uses of python?
- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Web Development
- 

## Companies using Python
- Google uses python in its web search system
- Intel, Cisco, HP, Seagate, Qualcomm, and IBM use python for hardware testing
- ESRI uses python as an end-user customization tool for its popular GIS mapping products
- Youtube is largely written in python

## Algorithm vs Program
- An algorithm is an idea or a way to solve a problem
- A program is a sequence of instructions written so that a computer can perform certain tasks.


## Python Syntax
### Variables in Python
A python variable stores a value in memory as a program runs. A variable is created by an equal to assignment.
e.g. x = 4, creates a variable called x which stores a value called 4.

A python variable can be reassigned or swapped. Different variables can store the same values.

### Math and expressions
- **Numbers**:There are two different types of numbers for arithmetic operations in python. These are "int" (e.g., 3, -4) for whole integer numbers and "float" (e.g. 2.45, -5.67) for decimal numbers.
- **Precedence**: Arithmetic operations in python follows the same precendence rules as in mathematics. Remember *BODMAS*!
- **Expressions**:
    - Division / yields float
    - Int Division // rounds to an integer
    - The ** operator does exponentiation
    - The "modulo" or "mod" operator is the remainder after division

### Print and Input
- The python print function `print()` takes in python data such as ints and strings and shows them in the terminal on one line of text. The items are converted to text form, separated by spaces.

- The input function `input()` allows us to take information from a particular user. That user information can further used in a program, or printed back to the user.

### If and Comparison
- The `if` statement controls if some lines run or not. The if statement syntax has four parts:
    - if
    - boolean test
    - colon
    - indented body lines

The simplest and most common boolean tests use `==` to compare two values and it's `True` if both values are the same.

- There's an optional `else:`part of an if statement that enables you to add code to run if the boolean test is `False`.

### While and For Loops
### Functions
### Data Structures
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Strings

## What is Pandas
### DataFrame Operations
- Read data
- operations and agregate functions
- groupby
- np.where with pandas
